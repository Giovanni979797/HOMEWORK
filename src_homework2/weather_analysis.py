    Exercise 3: Weather Data Analysis with Pandas
    ------------------------------------------
    Task: Analyze temperature and precipitation patterns.
    
    Required steps:
    1. Calculate basic statistics:
       - Monthly temperature averages
       - Total precipitation by month
       - Seasonal patterns
       - Temperature-precipitation correlation
    
    2. Create seasonal analysis:
       - Group data by seasons
       - Calculate seasonal averages
       - Identify extreme weather months
    
    3. Create visualizations:
       - Dual-axis plot for temperature and precipitation
       - Seasonal temperature averages
       - Temperature distribution
       - Temperature vs precipitation scatter plot
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame with columns:
        - Month: month names
        - Temperature: temperature values in Celsius
        - Precipitation: precipitation values in mm
    
    Expected Output:
    --------------
    1. Four-panel figure showing:
       - Temperature and precipitation trends
       - Seasonal averages
       - Temperature distribution
       - Correlation scatter plot
    2. Dictionary with weather statistics
    
    Hint: Use pd.cut for seasonal grouping
