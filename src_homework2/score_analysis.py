    Exercise 2: Student Score Analysis with NumPy
    ------------------------------------------
    Task: Analyze student performance across multiple subjects.
    
    Required steps:
    1. Calculate statistics for:
       - Each student's average performance
       - Each subject's average scores
       - Overall class performance
       
    2. Analyze score distribution:
       - Calculate standard deviation
       - Identify highest and lowest performing students
       - Determine score ranges for each subject
    
    3. Create visualizations:
       - Bar plot of student averages with error bars
       - Subject performance comparison
       - Score distribution histogram
       - Box plot for each subject
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    scores : numpy.ndarray
        2D array with shape (num_students, num_subjects)
        Each row represents a student
        Each column represents a subject
    
    Expected Output:
    --------------
    1. Four-panel figure showing:
       - Student performance bar plot
       - Subject averages bar plot
       - Score distribution histogram
       - Box plot by subject
    2. Dictionary with statistical analysis
    
    Hint: Use np.mean, np.std for calculations
